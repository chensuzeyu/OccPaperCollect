    "abstract":  "Diffusion models are advancing autonomous driving by enabling realistic data synthesis, predictive end-to-end planning, and closed-loop simulation, with a primary focus on temporally consistent generation. However, large-scale 3D scene generation requiring spatial coherence remains underexplored. In this paper, we present X-Scene, a novel framework for large-scale driving scene generation that achieves geometric intricacy, appearance fidelity, and flexible controllability. Specifically, X-Scene supports multi-granular control, including low-level layout conditioning driven by user input or text for detailed scene composition, and high-level semantic guidance informed by user intent and LLM-enriched prompts for efficient customization. To enhance geometric and visual fidelity, we introduce a unified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and corresponding multi-view images and videos, ensuring alignment and temporal consistency across modalities. We further extend local regions into large-scale scenes via consistency-aware outpainting, which extrapolates occupancy and images from previously generated areas to maintain spatial and visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted into high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as simulation and scene exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Scene substantially advances controllability and fidelity in large-scale scene generation, empowering data generation and simulation for autonomous driving.",
